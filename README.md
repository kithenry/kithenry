## Hi there 👋
- I am Keith Henry Nambale. Fourth year Computer Engineering student at [Eastern Mediterranean University](https://www.emu.edu.tr/en).
- I am enthusiastic about programming and how vast the amount of possibilities that there are for someone that is good at it. 
- I do some web development.
- My web programming relies on react and bootstrap for the front end , and python django for the backend


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a [visual path finding simulator in C++ and Python](https://github.com/kithenry/C-Path-Finder-Visualizer)
