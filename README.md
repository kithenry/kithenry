### 🐧 Linux | 🛠️ Self-Hosting | 📝 Org-Driven Workflows  
I live in the terminal (`zsh` + `tmux`), breathe in Org mode, and thrive on Arch’s rolling cadence.  
Not just a user—I build layers *on top* of the stack: custom tooling, offline-first systems, and commitment scaffolds.

### 🔧 Current Focus  
- 🎥 Building a self-hosted **media learning system** (video + timestamped notes via Org)  
- 🧠 Prototyping a personal chatbot for conversation-aware reflection & habit synthesis  
- 📊 Structuring life data: time, promises, finances — all parseable, all queryable  
- 📺 Interests*: automation, directed AI, Linux
